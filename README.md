PILN.py is a script that shows how one can adapt a premade dataset to train a PILN model for EM response prediction. 

NBTRM.py is a script that shows how one can  generate NURBS curves within the defined region and show some examples.

We create a pattern dataset through NBTRM.py and implement the training of the corresponding prediction model of the pattern layer with PILN.py.
